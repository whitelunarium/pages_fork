Earth’s intel vault has been wiped clean. Your first assignment is to revive the SQLite backbone that keeps orbital radar and field agents in sync.

## Mission Snapshot

- **Primary Goal:** Recreate `earth_base.db` with operational `Agents` and `Alien_Sightings` tables.
- **Key Actions:** Sketch the schema, spin up the database, create both tables, and seed critical intel.
- **Win Condition:** Automated radar checks confirm the tables pass validation, unlocking Code Fragment **ALPHA-7X9K**.

## Success Tips

- Draft column names and data types before you touch SQL.
- Validate each insert to ensure threat levels and clearance tiers match the mission brief.
- Keep a log of sample data; you’ll reference it when the radar lights back up.
