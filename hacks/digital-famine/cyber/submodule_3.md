# Mission 3 — Encrypt the Launch Codes

Alien scanners are sweeping for plaintext launch keys. Your objective is to cloak every code in SHA-256 armor before the countdown reaches zero.

## Mission Snapshot

- **Primary Goal:** Hash the entire launch code queue and confirm each digest before transmission.
- **Key Actions:** Stage incoming codes, run them through a SHA-256 routine, and verify the hashes match expected signatures.
- **Win Condition:** The defense shield acknowledges secured payloads and grants Code Fragment **CHARLIE-2N5P**.

## Success Tips

- Pair each digest with its original identifier so commanders can audit the shield later.
- Monitor processing time—batch hashing keeps you ahead of the alien scan sweep.
- Document the hashing steps; you may need the script when the final vault unlocks.
