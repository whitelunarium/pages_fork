# Final Sequence — Unlock the Sacred Vault

With all three fragments secure, it’s time to synthesize the vault PIN and recover the Sacred Page that ends the invasion.

## Mission Snapshot

- **Primary Goal:** Combine Code Fragments ALPHA, BRAVO, and CHARLIE into the four-digit vault PIN.
- **Key Actions:** Validate each fragment order, authenticate against vault telemetry, and initiate the unlock protocol.
- **Win Condition:** Vault doors open, the Sacred Page is retrieved, and Earth’s defense algorithms are restored.

## Success Tips

- Double-check mission logs so fragments enter the sequence in the order they were earned.
- Keep communication channels clear—vault sentinels will halt the unlock on any mismatch.
- Capture the final telemetry; it verifies Earth’s defenses in post-mission debriefs.
