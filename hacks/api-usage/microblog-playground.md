## Microblogging

The premise is to have an engaging way to chat on articles.

### Frontmatter

Observe the frontmatter on these pages; it now includes `microblog: True` to enable microblogging.

## Microblogging: Engage Your Readers

Microblogging adds a real-time, interactive chat panel to your articles, allowing readers to comment, ask questions, and discuss content directly alongside your lesson or post. This feature is designed to boost engagement and foster community around your content.

### How It Works

- A floating "Microblog" button appears on pages with microblogging enabled.
- Clicking the button opens a side panel where users can read and post short messages.
- The panel is mobile-friendly and overlays the main content without disrupting the reading experience.
- All microblog logic and dependencies are managed centrally, so you only need to enable it in your page’s frontmatter.

### Enabling Microblogging


To add microblogging to any article or lesson, simply include the following in your page’s frontmatter.  **The permalink is your topic.**

```yaml
---
layout: post
microblog: True
title: Your Article Title
description: Brief description of your article.
author: Your Name
permalink: /your-path
---
```

- Use `layout: opencs` to ensure the microblog overlay and dependencies are included.
- Set `microblog: True` to activate the feature.


### To Test Microblogging

In your project directory with your virtual environment (venv) activated:

```sh
git pull
./scripts/db_init.py # if you have database trouble
python main.py
```

### Key Files

- `_layouts/opencs.html` — Main layout that injects the microblog overlay and required scripts.
- `assets/js/api/microblog.js` — Handles the microblog panel’s interactivity and API calls.


### API Reference
