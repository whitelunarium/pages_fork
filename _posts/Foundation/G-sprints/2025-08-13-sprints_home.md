## Why Sprints Matter

Sprints are the engine of modern project development. They break big goals into focused, manageable steps, helping teams stay organized, deliver faster, and adapt quickly to feedback. By working in weekly sprints, you’ll learn how real-world developers plan, build, and refine software: one step at a time.
