    "## Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the game running, let's talk about the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Canvas of the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for anything to show up on your screen in the first place, we have to create a `canvas` for everything to be drawn on. The `canvas` is defined in `HTML`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<canvas id=\"world\"></canvas>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a canvas, but there isn't anything in it. We can write `JavaScript` code to modify the canvas. However, we have an HTML page, so we need to tell the page where the JavaScript code is using a `script` tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<canvas id=\"world\"></canvas>\n",
    "<script>\n",
    "  // Our Javascript code is going to go here!\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that most `HTML` tags have a starting tag (`<tagname>`) and an ending tag (`</tagname>`), and everything in between is inside of those tags. All of our JavaScript code should be between the starting and ending `script` tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the game needs to connect to the Document Object Model (DOM) element for the canvas.  We have named the HTML element's id `world`, and we will define a `GameWorld` class to manage the `canvas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to need to **declare variables** inside the GameWorld class using the keyword `this`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "this.canvas = document.getElementById(\"world\");\n",
    "// document.getElementById(\"world\") finds the <canvas id=\"world\"> element in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "this.ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n",
    "// every canvas has a drawing context. for example, getContext('2d') returns the 2D drawing API (methods like drawImage, fillRect, clearRect).\n",
    "// canvas is the DOM element; ctx is what draws pixels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sizing the Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "Toward the bottom of the JavaScript `<script>` tag, just before the closing `</script>` tag, you will find the `GameWorld` class. We have defined this code to manage everything that writes to the canvas, aka game world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to setup the `GameWorld`\n",
    "- The `canvas` is setup to match window screen.  Look at all the `this.canvas` commands.\n",
    "- The `ctx` is used to draw into the canvas\n",
    "- The `game objects` are assigned to the `this.gameObjects` array. These game pieces are inserted into the GameWorld.\n",
    "- In object oriented programming language...\n",
    "  - The `GameWorld` has-a `Background`\n",
    "  - The `GameWorld` has-a `Player`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "class GameWorld {\n",
    "  static gameSpeed = 5;\n",
    "  constructor(backgroundImg, spriteImg) {\n",
    "    this.canvas = document.getElementById(\"world\");\n",
    "    this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');\n",
    "    this.width = window.innerWidth;\n",
    "    this.height = window.innerHeight;\n",
    "    this.canvas.width = this.width;\n",
    "    this.canvas.height = this.height;\n",
    "    this.canvas.style.width = `${this.width}px`;\n",
    "    this.canvas.style.height = `${this.height}px`;\n",
    "    this.canvas.style.position = 'absolute';\n",
    "    this.canvas.style.left = `0px`;\n",
    "    this.canvas.style.top = `${(window.innerHeight - this.height) / 2}px`;\n",
    "\n",
    "    this.objects = [\n",
    "      new Background(backgroundImg, this),\n",
    "      new Player(spriteImg, this)\n",
    "    ];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of definitions that could be commented in the above code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "`canvas.width`, `canvas.height`: set the drawing buffer size (pixel resolution of the canvas).\n",
    "\n",
    "`canvas.style.width`, `canvas.style.height`: set the **CSS** size (how big it appears on screen).\n",
    "They set both equal so the drawing area matches the visible size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In our game, everything that appears on the screen (like the alien planet background or the UFO sprite) can be thought of as a **game object**.\n",
    "Instead of writing separate code for each image, we create a **class** that acts like a blueprint.  This blueprint is defined in the `class GameObject`\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "class GameObject {\n",
    "  constructor(image, width, height, x = 0, y = 0, speedRatio = 0) {\n",
    "    this.image = image;       // what picture to draw\n",
    "    this.width = width;       // how wide to draw it\n",
    "    this.height = height;     // how tall to draw it\n",
    "    this.x = x;               // where it is horizontally\n",
    "    this.y = y;               // where it is vertically\n",
    "    this.speedRatio = speedRatio;\n",
    "    this.speed = gameSpeed * this.speedRatio; // how fast it moves\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  update() {\n",
    "    // gets filled in by subclasses (like Background)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  draw(ctx) {\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of hardcoding the background or sprite separately, we can now make them instances of the `GameObject` class. Look for the `Background` and `Player` classes in the `<script>` code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `Background` and `Player` classes use the keyword extends in their definition, they `inherit` the properties of `GameObject`. Inheritance is a key to OOP programming and using OOP language we say.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Background` is-a `GameObject`\n",
    "- The `Player` is-a `GameObject`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Our background is a special game object: it has to **move sideways** forever to look like the player is moving. To make it seamless, we draw **two copies** of the background image side-by-side. As one scrolls off the screen, the other one takes its place.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` js\n",
    "class Background extends GameObject {\n",
    "  constructor(image, gameWorld) {\n",
    "    // Fill entire canvas\n",
    "    super(image, gameWorld.width, gameWorld.height, 0, 0, 0.1);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  update() {\n",
    "    this.x = (this.x - this.speed) % this.width;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  draw(ctx) {\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x + this.width, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard part of `Background` is it uses a `super` call to `GameObject` to define it's `this` attributes like this.x, this.y, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special part is that it `overrides` or customizes the `update()` and `draw()` methods for its unique behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update()` moves the background a little bit every frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The % this.width (modulo) makes sure it “wraps around” so the background never disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "`draw()` paints two backgrounds so there’s no empty gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Game Loop (Animation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of a game is the `gameLoop` that keeps running continuously. This is where things get updated and redrawn, frame after frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "gameLoop() {\n",
    "  this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "  for (const obj of this.objects) {\n",
    "    obj.update();\n",
    "    obj.draw(this.ctx);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  requestAnimationFrame(this.gameLoop.bind(this));\n",
    "}\n",
    "start() {\n",
    "  this.gameLoop();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`clearRect` wipes the screen so old frames so they don’t overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` cycles through every gameObject we defined with the GameWorld constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update` typically changes object positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`draw` places the image onto the canvas according to recent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "`requestAnimationFrame` tells the browser to “do this again on the next frame.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what makes the background look alive — it’s being redrawn 60 times per second!\n"
