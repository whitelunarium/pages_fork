    "## 📚 Project-based Learning Requirements\n",
    "Each sprint will include hacks and project-based learning requirements. It is up to each individual to develop their own plan for representing their work. Here are some links and tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All work and tangible artifacts will be captured in a personal GitHub Issue\n",
    "- To obtain clarity on instructions, you should start a task, work with a peer, and then ask questions of the Teacher\n",
    "\n",
    "In Education, there is a framework called **Bloom's Taxonomy** which represents the standards for learning. We will use these levels to guide your technical evaluation for this Sprint:\n",
    "  - **📝 Remember** - Recall facts and basic concepts about tools and commands\n",
    "  - **💡 Understand** - Explain how tools work and their purpose in development workflow  \n",
    "  - **⚙️ Apply** - Perform basic setup, installation, and coding tasks\n",
    "  - **🔍 Analyze** - Troubleshoot problems by examining logs, error messages, and system behavior\n",
    "  - **📊 Evaluate** - Assess and correct errors, compare solutions, and make correct tool choices\n",
    "  - **🎨 Create** - Produce original code, customize configurations, and add to projects\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Agile Development** methodology, which we will learn throughout the course, the focus is on delivery, iteration, and management (plans, designs, code, test,reviews, deploy, and continuous improvement). We will use these principles to guide your soft skills evaluation for this Sprint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Plan → Code → Test → Review → Deploy → Iterate\n",
    "  ↑                                        ↓\n",
    "  ← ← ← ← Continuous Improvement ← ← ← ← ←\n",
    "```\n",
    "  - **Self-management** - Taking ownership of your learning\n",
    "  - **Incremental progression** - Building skills step by step\n",
    "  - **Self-organization** - Managing your time and priorities\n",
    "  - **Iterative techniques** - Refining work through cycles\n",
    "  - **Continuous delivery** - Consistently producing quality work\n",
    "\n",
    "We will combine Bloom's Taxonomy and Agile Development to form a **Hyperflex Classroom**. As we build skills and behaviors, we should be able to adjust what we do and learn based on success and trust.\n",
    "\n",

    "**🚀 Ready to Begin Your CS Journey?**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **💡 Key Points:**\n",
    "> - There are very few \"correct answers\" in this class! As you code, you will see there are always more mistakes to be made, features and bugs to work on\n",
    "> - Those who achieve high grades typically engage in work that interests them, talk a lot in class about work with peers, and learn to be comfortable sharing mistakes and failures\n",
    "> - You will earn points if you can \"show\" that you are progressing on your Computer Science journey - the checklist below helps form those habits\n",
    "> - Corporations in America are paying insane amounts of money to those who improve and expedite their work with AI usage, read about META\n",
    "> - **Junior Developer: $85,000+ | Scrum Master: $110,000+ | Senior Developer: $120,000+ | AI-Skilled Developer: $150,000+ | AI-Skilled Developer/Manager: $250,000++**\n",
    "> - **The highest-paid roles require both coding AND people skills - just like what we practice in this classroom!**\n",
    "> - **More than the money, it provides satisfaction to get out of your shell and \"create\"**"

    "\n",
    "In CompSci, there are always more features to add, bugs to fix, and improvements to make. This iterative approach is fundamental to both programming and the Agile methodologies we'll be learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Productive Learning Behaviors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🔔 Attention Signal**: \"Hey, Hey, Hey\" or bell ringing means stop and listen. Most demonstrations will be under 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **💻 Work Mode**: \"Code, Code, Code\" means it's time to actively work. This includes planning, designing, researching, asking questions, and actual coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **👂 Active Listening**: Be available for discussion 100% of the time. Earbuds/headphones should not block your ability to hear instructions or collaborate with peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🛠️ Hands-On Learning**: Your laptop is your primary learning tool. Sprint 1 focuses on mastering your development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🗣️ Technical Discourse**: Aim for 80%+ of your classroom conversation to be about code, problem-solving, and technical concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **📱 Digital-First**: No paper!  All work is done electronically. Paper-based work indicates disengagement from our digital learning environment.\n",
