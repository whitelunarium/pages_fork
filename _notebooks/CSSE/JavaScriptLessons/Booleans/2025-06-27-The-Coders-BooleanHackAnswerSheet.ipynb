    "## 📖 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Boolean Logic Hack Challenge For Calculator**! This blog post will guide you through practical exercises that reinforce your understanding of boolean operations. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills, these challenges will help you think like a programmer.\n",

    "### What You've Learn:\n",
    "- ✅ Practical boolean applications\n",
    "- 🔍 Logical reasoning with AND, OR, NOT\n",
    "- 💡 How to use them in your code\n",
    "- 🎯 What exactly they do\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before we start:\n",
    "Make sure to know that \"_____\" in this blog means that **YOU** have put something inside it and make it how you want it to be like!\n",

    "## 🎯 Challenge #1: User Authentication System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're building a login system for a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// Challenge: Write boolean expressions for these conditions\n",
    "var hasDecimal = false;       // true if current number already has a decimal\n",
    "var isNegative = false;       // true if current number is negative\n",
    "var justCalculated = false;   // true right after you press \"=\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this to help you have an idea on how to use Booleans in your calculator hack.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add Boolean Flags, as shown above to help further improve you calculator blog. These are pure booleans (true/false) to track state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Hint:** Think about when your calculator should accept decimal input, when it should clear the display, and when it should prevent duplicate operations.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🏪 Challenge #2: One-time Decimal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You only want one decimal point in your number.\n",

    "```js\n",
    "let hasDot = false;        // start false = no decimal yet\n",
    "```\n",

    "    display += \".\";\n",

    "// If hasDot is already true, ignore the click\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hopefully this layout helps you!\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Think About:** When should the decimal be allowed? When should it be blocked? Use the NOT operator (!) to check if something is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎮 Challenge #3: Start Fresh After \"=\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** I want to have nothing on my calculator text box after the \"=\" button is clicked\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let justDone = false;      // false = still typing\n",
    "\n",
    "// when you press equals:\n",

    "// when you type a new number:\n",
    "if (justDone) {\n",

    "  justDone = false;        // back to typing mode\n",

    "**Scenario:** The Negative / Positive Toggle clip is basically a mini \"± button\" for your calculator.\n",

    "  output.innerHTML = \"-\" + output.innerHTML;\n",
    "  isNeg = true;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it Does\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let isNeg = false;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This boolean keeps track of the current sign of the number.\n",
    "- false = positive, true = negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "if (isNeg) { ... } else { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Checks the current sign.\n",
    "- If it's negative (true), it removes the minus sign.\n",
    "- If it's positive (false), it adds a minus sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "output.innerHTML = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Actually changes what the user sees on the calculator screen.\n",
    "- isNeg = true/false\n",
    "- Updates the boolean so the next press knows the current sign.\n",

    "These challenges mirror real-world programming scenarios. Boolean logic is the foundation of decision-making in software!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Solution Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Always Name Your Booleans Clearly:\n",
    "Use `is`, `has`, `can` in front of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Booleans to Track State:\n",
    "Think of booleans as tiny switches: `true` = \"on\", `false` = \"off\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reset Booleans When Needed:\n",
    "Whenever a new number starts or the user clears the calculator, **reset flags**:\n",
    "A boolean flag is like a tiny sticky note in your program saying \"this thing happened\" or \"this thing is active.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "| Flag name | Meaning |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|\n",
    "| `hasDot` | The current number already has a decimal `.` |\n",
    "| `justCalculated` | User just pressed `=` and finished a calculation |\n",
    "| `isNegative` | Current number is negative |\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new number starts or the user presses A/C, these flags may no longer reflect the new number's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why resetting is necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the user types 3.5 → hasDot = true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user presses + and starts typing a new number **without resetting** hasDot, the calculator thinks the new number **already has a decimal** and won't allow another ..\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with justCalculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "After = is pressed, justCalculated = true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user wants to type a new number, the program needs to know to **start fresh**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Booleans with Conditional Logic:\n",
    "Combine them with `if`, `else` to control behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep Them Small & Simple:\n",
    "Don't store values in booleans other than `true` or `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One boolean per \"thing you need to remember\" is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL;DR:\n",
    " Booleans = memory switches.\n",
    "\n",
    "`true` → yes, it's on / already done / active.\n",
    "\n",
    "`false` → no, it's off / hasn't happened / inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use them to **control what the calculator lets the user do next.**\n",
