    "1. **Divide**: We keep splitting the batch of cupcakes into halves until each sub-batch is a single cupcake (or no cupcakes). A single cupcake doesn’t need sorting!\n",
    "2. **Conquer**: Each of these single-cupcake batches is trivially sorted.\n",
    "3. **Combine**: We start merging the little batches back together. At every merge step, we ensure cupcakes end up in ascending order (least sweet to most sweet). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity in a Nutshell\n",
    "- At each level of splitting, we perform `O(n)` work to merge the halves.\n",
    "- There are about `log n` levels of splitting (because we divide in half each time).\n",

    "1. **Copy** the `merge_sort` and `merge` functions.\n",
    "2. **Adjust** the comparison so that the larger element is chosen first.\n",
    "3. **Test** your updated code on a random list of integers to confirm you get a descending result.\n",

    "-   [27]  is already sorted. \n",
    "-  [43]  is already sorted. \n",
    "-  [10]  is already sorted. \n",
    "### Merge: \n",
    "-  Merge  [38]  and  [27]  to get  [27, 38]  . \n",
    "-   Merge  [43]  and  [10]  to get  [10,43]  . \n",

    "1. **Form a Line**  \n",
    "   - Eight volunteers stand in a single, unordered line (each wearing a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split Into Halves**  \n",
    "   - Split into two groups: left half and right half. Then keep splitting until each group is down to a single person.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merge**  \n",
    "   - To merge two sorted groups, compare the front individuals’ numbers: the lower number moves first into the new “sorted line.” Continue until all members from both groups stand in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat**  \n",
    "   - Merge sorted pairs into bigger sorted groups. Keep merging until everyone is back in one fully sorted line.\n",

    "- **Divide & Conquer**: Splitting until single elements are already “sorted.”  \n",

    "   \n",
    "2. **Inversion Counter** *(Optional, Extra Challenge)*:\n",
    "   - Modify the merge process to **count** how many times elements from the `right` array are placed before elements of the `left` array. This count is the number of *inversions*, a measure of \"how unsorted\" the list was.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Linked List Sorting** *(Choose if you’re adventurous)*:\n",
    "   - Instead of an array or list, implement a Merge Sort for a singly linked list. This can be done by finding the middle node, splitting the list, and then merging.\n",
