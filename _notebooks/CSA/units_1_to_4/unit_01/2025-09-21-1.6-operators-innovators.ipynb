    "##### A **compound assignment operator** combines an arithmetic (or other) operation with an assignment in one statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example, instead of writing:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "score = score + 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**You can write:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "score += 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Learning Goals For End of Lesson\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "- Transform clunky `x = x + y` statements into sleek compound assignments\n",
    "- Master all the essential operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `++`, `--`)\n",
    "- Understand evaluation order and avoid common traps\n"

    "| `*=`     | `x = x * y`         | Multiply — useful for scaling, growth, repeated doubling or factors. |\n",
    "| `/=`     | `x = x / y`         | Divide — scaling down; used in averages, proportions. (Watch out: integer division if both operands are ints.) |\n",
    "| `%=`     | `x = x % y`         | Remainder after division — wrap-around logic, parity checks, keeping things within bounds. |\n",
    "| `++`     | `x = x + 1`         | Add one; often used in loops, counters. |\n",
    "| `--`     | `x = x - 1`         | Subtract one; used in loops as well as decrementing counters. |"
