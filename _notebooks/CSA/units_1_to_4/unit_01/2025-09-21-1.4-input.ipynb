    "### Scanner Methods Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scanner class provides several methods for reading different types of input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`nextInt()`** - Reads the next integer value (e.g., `42`)\n",
    "- **`nextDouble()`** - Reads the next decimal number (e.g., `3.14`)\n",
    "- **`next()`** - Reads the next word up to whitespace (e.g., `\"Hello\"`)\n",
    "- **`nextLine()`** - Reads an entire line including spaces (e.g., `\"Hello World\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Pitfall: The nextInt() / nextLine() Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most common stumbling blocks for Java beginners. Understanding it requires knowledge of how input buffers work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:**\n",
    "When you call `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, or `next()`, these methods read only their specific token (the integer, double, or word). Critically, they **do not consume the newline character** (`\\n`) that's created when the user presses Enter. This leftover newline sits in the input buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you then call `nextLine()`, it immediately encounters this leftover newline, interprets it as an empty line, and returns an empty string without waiting for user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input Buffer: [2][5][\\n][R][e][m][a][i][n][i][n][g]...\n",
    "              ↑\n",
