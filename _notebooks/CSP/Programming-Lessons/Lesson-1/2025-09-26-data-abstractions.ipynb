    "Data abstraction means *treating collections of values as a single unit* (like a list, array, or string), so you don’t have to think about all the small details every time you use them. This manages complexity by letting us use a name (like `numbers`) instead of repeatedly referencing each individual element.\n",

    "Instead of thinking about *every score individually*, you can use the abstraction \"list of scores.\"\n",
    "- With a name (`scores`), you manipulate the entire group.\n",
    "- You don't need to worry about how the list is stored in memory.\n",
    "- Functions and loops let you work with the *concept* of a collection, not every detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we mean by the last part may be a bit more understandable in some examples of benefits.\n",
    "- Easier maintenance (add/remove scores without rewriting logic over and over again).\n",
    "- Reusable functions (average can work for any list of numbers).\n",
    "- Clearer code (you read \"average of scores\" instead of `score1 + score2 + score3 + ...`)."

    "- A *list* is an ordered sequence of elements. For example, `[value1, value2, value3, ...]` describes a list where `value1` is the first element, `value2` is the second element, and `value3` is the third element, and so on.\n",

    "- Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation.\n",
    "- Data abstractions manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the  representation.\n",
    "- Data abstractions can be created using lists.\n",
    "- Developing a data abstraction to implement in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain.\n",
    "- Data abstractions often contain different types of elements.\n",
    "- The use of lists allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value. Lists are referred to by different names such as array, depending on the programming language.\n",
